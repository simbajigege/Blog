# Hello from Docusaurus

Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple" default>
    This is an apple 🍎

    ## this is header apple

	## Only h2 and h3 will be in the TOC by default

	You can configure the TOC heading levels either per-document or in the theme configuration.

	The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">
    This is an orange 🍊
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">
    This is a banana 🍌
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

## Only h2 and h3 will be in the TOC by default.

You can configure the TOC heading levels either per-document or in the theme configuration.

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times
